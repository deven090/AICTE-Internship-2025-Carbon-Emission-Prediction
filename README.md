# Carbon Emission prediction

This project aims to predict multiple carbon emission indicators using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.

## Overview

Climate change and global warming are among the most urgent environmental challenges today. Accurate prediction of carbon emission levels can help policymakers, industries, and environmentalists take data-driven actions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring sustainable practices.

In this project, we:

1 Collected and preprocessed real-world carbon       emission datasets


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.12

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation
## 📊 Predicted Carbon Emission Indicators

The model predicts multiple emission-related parameters, including:

CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) from year 1990 to 2011
